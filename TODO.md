# Major
- [ ] Complete this ToDo list :sweat_smile:
- [ ] Make the library header only
- [ ] Create CMake configuration files
- [ ] Improve MainWindow GUI
- [ ] Manage multiple pickable objects drawn in the Canvas
- [ ] Unify Meshes data structures under single abstract class
- [ ] Add a brief explanation of the content of headers containing functions (no classes)
- [ ] Support LibIGL module with MSVC

# Minor
- Data Structure:
  - [ ] BipartiteGraph inherits from Graph
- Meshes:
  - [ ] Reorganize EigenMeshAlgorithms
  - [ ] Put Dcel and EigenMesh under a module called Meshes
  - [ ] viewer/interfaces becames viewer/abstract_classes
  - [ ] viewer/renderable_objects becames viewer/opengl_functions

# To Implement
- Algorithms:
  - [ ] Marching Cubes
  - [ ] Taubin Smoothing
  - [ ] Extract SubGraph from Graphs

# Missing Abstract Classes Inheritance
- Data Structures:
  - [ ] graphs/graph
  - [ ] all the trees

# Missing Documentation
- Core:
  - [ ] geometry/2d/line2d
  - [ ] geometry/line
  - [ ] geometry/plane
  - [ ] geometry/segment
  - [ ] geometry/triangle
